# SpiroGreg
SpiroGreg is an app I worked on previously before I learned git. I'm now adding it to git as I would like to add extra functionality to it. I wanted to learn SFML and C++ and use them to possibly make a game. I made this instead, a cool and fun visual demo that can also give some intuition into how Fourier Theorem (https://www.mtsu.edu/faculty/wroberts/teaching/fourier_4.php) from works, i.e. how complex patterns can arise out of simple periodic waveforms. 

# Installation Instructions
Detailed (but Visual Studio specific) instructions coming soon... 

# Usage
- Follow installation instructions above, then run the program, a command line will appear
- Add the number of "arm" segments you would like to add to your drawing machine, hit enter
- Add the length and speed for each arm, hit enter
- Choose a color pattern, hit enter
- The animation will start playing. You may press certain keys on your keyboard to get actions to happen. Commands listed below.

# Commands
L -- makes drawing machine arms invisible   
P -- takes a photo of your pattern in its current state    
B -- changes background color (caution, some settings contain flashing colors!)    
Down Arrow -- allows you to cycle between color patterns in the middle of animation

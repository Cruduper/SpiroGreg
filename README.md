This is an app I worked on previously before I learned git. I wanted to learn SFML and C++ and use them to possibly make a game. I made this instead, a cool and fun visual demo that can also give some intuition into how Fourier Theorem (https://www.mtsu.edu/faculty/wroberts/teaching/fourier_4.php) from works, i.e. how complex patterns can arise out of simply periodic waveforms.

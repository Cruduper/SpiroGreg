# SpiroGreg

### üìñ Description
SpiroGreg is a spirograph-like drawing program that allows you to attach several arms that rotate in a circle end to end. Each arm has a different user-definable length and angular velocity, and the outside edge of the final arm draws it's path onto the screen. The end result is a spirograph-like pattern, which you can augment with different color schemes or take screenshots of. This should also give some intuition into how Fourier Theorem (https://www.mtsu.edu/faculty/wroberts/teaching/fourier_4.php) works if you've taken Differential Equations in school, i.e. how complex patterns can arise out of simple periodic waveforms.

SpiroGreg is an app I made years ago before I learned git, while learning SFML and C++. It was originally created using SFML 2.4, but I have updated it to use the latest version. I will also be making improvements to both code cleanliness (not great currently) and user friendliness. 

### üõ† Technologies Used
- C++
- SFML 2.6

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup/Installation Requirements
Detailed (but Visual Studio specific) instructions coming soon... 

### üñ•Ô∏è Usage
- Follow installation instructions above, then run the program, a command line will appear
- Add the number of "arm" segments you would like to add to your drawing machine, hit enter
- Add the length and speed for each arm, hit enter
- Choose a color pattern, hit enter
- The animation will start playing. You may press certain keys on your keyboard to get actions to happen. Commands listed below.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Runtime Keyboard Controls
L key ‚Äî makes drawing machine arms invisible   \
P key ‚Äî takes a photo of your pattern in its current state   \
B key ‚Äî changes background color (caution, some settings contain flashing colors!)   \
Down Arrow  ‚Äî allows you to cycle between color patterns in the middle of animation   \
Esc ‚Äî close window   \

### ü¶† Known Bugs OR Issues
- "secondsToRepeat" seems to be calculated incorrectly, and should have a different name when displayed to the user
- When taking a screen shot, often the drawing will freeze and then create an erroneous solid line once drawing resumes
- The inputs for each arm should come from a UI, not command line
- User should be able to restart a new drawing without restarting the program
